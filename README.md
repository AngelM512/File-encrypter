# File-encrypter
Author: Angel Moreta

This program consists in asking the user what file will be incrypted(must be in the same directory)

new features coming: 
    - The user will have the ability the create a password for the file to be seen.
    - The program will potencially be able to decrypt a file as well.
    - Better code structure; in a way that can be more understandable and easy to follow.
